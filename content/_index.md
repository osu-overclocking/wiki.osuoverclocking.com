## Welcome to the OSU Overclocking Wiki

Here is where we keep all of our documentation on how to overclock our computers.
You will find sections for all the major overclockable components as well as 
detailed instructions for specific versions of those components. 

Feel free to contribute to this documentation as it is a resource for anyone who
wishes to use it!
