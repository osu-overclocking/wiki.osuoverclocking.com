High End Desktop is the highest level of consumer CPU's that are capable of high workflow and processing. These chips sit above the i9 or Ryzen 9 level of chips but below full fledged server grade hardware like the Intel Xeon or the MAD Epyc chips. These chips often come on their own modified architecture for example the 10980XE uses a mesh interconnect versus the traditional i9's ring. The also have larger feature sets including but not limited too: extra PCI-E lanes, more memory channels, more hardware acceleration features, greater I/O capacity, etc.
